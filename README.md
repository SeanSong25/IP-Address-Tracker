# Frontend Mentor - IP address tracker

![Design preview for the IP address tracker coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## The Project
Simply enter the IP address and click the button, then the IPify API will send back the actual location, and direct the Leaflet API towards the actual position on the map.

### That's it, play around with it and have fun!!!
